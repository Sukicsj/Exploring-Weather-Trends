# Exploring-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 1 

# Instructions
The goal of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Singapore.

# Steps
1. Extract the data using SQL
2. Create a line chart that compares Singapore's temperatures with the global temperatures. 
3. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Singapore's averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.

# Submission
- An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as
- What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
- How did you calculate the moving average?
- What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
- Line chart with local and global temperature trends
- At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends

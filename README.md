# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 1 
# Exploring-Weather-Trends

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Singapore.

Tools used : SQL, Microsoft Excel, Analysis Toolpak Add-ins 

# Insights Drawn from the Analysis
1. The consistent upward trend is observed in both Singapore and global average temperature. We can deduce that the world is getting warmer. 
2. The average temperature in Singapore gradually increased to around 28 degree Celsius from 25 degree Celsius; and global average temperature rose from 8 degree Celsius to around 10 degree Celsius. 

# Regression Analysis
1.  Linear Regression Equation: 
Singapore Average Temperature = 0.8701 * Global Average Temperature - 14.5548
2. The Correlation Coefficient is 0.9755, which shows strong positive relationship. 
This implies that Singapore average temperature increases when global temperature increases
3. The r-square is 0.9518, which indicates that 95% of the dependent variables (global temperature) are explained by the independent variable. 
4. The standard error is 0.07186 or 7.186%, which is relatively low. This shows that the regression analysis has a high precision (above 90%) 
5. From the ANOVA analysis, Significance F shows a value of 0.000 (less than 0.05), which indicates the model is a good model. 
6. The model is a good model to make prediction of the Singapore average temperature given global average temperature.
